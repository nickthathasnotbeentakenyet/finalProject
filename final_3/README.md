# JSON file
**NOTE:** the included json file is not required.
*it is included in case you don't want to spend time adding data to be later shown in statistics*
The program will check if json is present. If not - it will create one.

# DOCUMENTATION , TEST FUNCTIONS, ETC.
Since this is the third final project for this class, I simply don't have enough time(due to other classes and other stuff in life) to finish it by adding documentation, test functions, and stuff like that. 
I am sharing it just to show that I was/am working on a project that utilizes *JSON*, *numpy*, and *matplotlib*
